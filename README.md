# Music-Genre-Grouper
MP3 music files support multiple genres, however few media players appear to support the feature. The listener is then has two options:

1. Use the 'correct' genre in the music file (i.e. 'Garage Rock'). The problem here is that many music players can only play tracks of one genre, so the selection of 'Garage Rock' may be limited.
2. Use a more generic genre (i.e. 'Rock' instead of 'Garage Rock'). This is not ideal as it results in very few genres.

The aim of the Music Genre Grouper is to perform genre grouping, primarily for media players. Genre grouping could be grouping 'Alternative Rock', 'Classic Rock', 'Hard Rock', 'Southern Rock' in the genre 'Rock'. This can be achieved a number of ways:

1. For media players that have good playlist support, the Music Genre Grouper can create a playlist for each genre group (i.e. Rock, Classical, Electronic) of all the files on the device.
2. For media players that have good genre support, the Music Genre Grouper can modify the genre of each music file to the genre group. As this will change the genre, this is best used when music is copied from a library to USB drive, memory stick or music player.
